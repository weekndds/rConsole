basically

1. install python (https://python.org/downloads/)
2. open cmd console and cd into the directory of the files
3. do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. then run client.py and execute the rConsole.lua script or use the loadstring below.

it has support for colors like @@RED@@ and shit, just look at the python file if you wanna see all the supported colors.

`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weekndds/rConsole/refs/heads/main/rConsole.lua")`
